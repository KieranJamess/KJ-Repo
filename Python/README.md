## Welcome to my Python scripts!

I am currently in the middle of learning python and wanted to store the little ideas I came up with and made whilst learning.

### Odds on game

This is a game where you are competing against the computer on odds on. You input your desired number, and input the range you want the computer to use. It will choose a number in that range. If your number is the same number the computer choses, you win! 

### Math Game

As the title suggests, it's a simple math game. It has a scoreboard so you know how exactly good you are at maths. The numbers ranges from 1 to 12. 

### Dice Roller

The dice roller games has two defined functions depending what dice game you want. You have the standard 6 sided dice, or you can have the DnD dice which has a dictionary to call for the number list, depending on the user input.
