I am currently in the middle of learning python and wanted to store the little ideas I came up with and made whilst learning.

### Odds on game

This is a game where you are competing against the computer on odds on. You input your desired number, and input the range you want the computer to use. It will choose a number in that range. If your number is the same number the computer choses, you win! 

### Math Game
