## Welcome to my Python scripts!

I am currently in the middle of learning python and wanted to store the little ideas I came up with and made whilst learning.

### RNAS Script

The RNAS script is a random number allocation system that is used for competitions basis. It'll ask how many tickets does the raffle have, who the user is, and ask how many tickets they have. It'll then assign random number(s) in that range to that user using a python dictionary.
